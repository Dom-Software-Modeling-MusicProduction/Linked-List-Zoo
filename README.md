# Linked-List-Zoo

This project is a simple activity that allows the user to manage an animal zoo, which is essentially a list of animals that can be dynamically updated based on the selected option. The result is a basic simulation where you effectively get to manage your own personal zoo. 

# What Techniques Were Incorporated

This program used dynamic memory management and allocation, through the usage of nodes and pointers. Fundamental programming terminology like "new", the dereferencing operator ("*"), and "delete[]" were considered in the production of this program.  

# How It Works

Upon executing the following program, the user will be presented with a list of options (1 through 8) that present different ways to manage their virtual zoo. The user can stop playing at any time and add as many animals as they see fit (at least, until they run out of memory space, which requires a large number of animals). They will also be able to delete as many animals as they wish, until there are no more animals present. The user can classify each animal with their own choice of species and age for each new dynamically created animal. 

# Execution

To run the following program, clone the repository to your computer, and then since the file is a C++ file, execute the program using the command line g++.

# Purpose

This project was intended to practice some more advanced material in the first semester computer programming concepts, such as pointer variables, pointer functions, dynamic memory management, linked lists, conditionals, and handling user input and output.
